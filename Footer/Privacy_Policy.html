                <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold">1. Introduction</h2>
                <p>Welcome to our Pokém-Info website! Your privacy is important to us. This Privacy Policy explains how
                    we handle any data on our site. Please note that this is a frontend-only project, meaning we do not
                    collect, store, or process any personal data from users.</p>

                <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold">2. Information We Collect</h2>
                <p>As a frontend-only website, we do not collect or store any personal information. We do not have a
                    backend or database to process user data. Any interaction you have with the site, including using
                    the Pokémon API to fetch data and AI-generated Pokémon images, does not involve storing personal
                    data.</p>

                <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold">3. AI-Generated Pokémon Images</h2>
                <p>Our website uses artificial intelligence to generate Pokémon images based on user interactions. These
                    images are for visual representation purposes only and are not linked to any personal information.
                    No data is stored regarding your image generation or interactions on the site.</p>

                <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold">4. Cookies</h2>
                <p>We do not use cookies to collect any personal information or track users. Cookies may be used for
                    basic functionality, such as ensuring a smooth user experience while navigating through the site,
                    but no personal data is stored.</p>

                <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold">5. Third-Party Services</h2>
                <p>Our site uses the Pokémon API to retrieve Pokémon data (such as abilities, types, evolutions, and
                    other information). However, we do not store or share any data retrieved from the API. The Pokémon
                    API is only used to display data on the website in real-time and does not collect any personal
                    information.</p>

                <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold">6. Data Security</h2>
                <p>As we do not store any personal data, there is no risk to your privacy in terms of data security. Our
                    website is a frontend-only application, meaning there is no backend infrastructure to manage or
                    secure user information.</p>

                <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold">7. Your Rights</h2>
                <p>Since we do not collect or store any personal information, there are no rights related to accessing,
                    correcting, or deleting your personal data. You can simply choose not to interact with the website
                    or use its features if you prefer.</p>

                <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold">8. Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>
                <p>We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. If there are any changes, we will update the
                    "Effective Date" above. Please review this page periodically for any updates. As we do not store any
                    data, changes to the policy will have minimal impact on your experience with the site.</p>
